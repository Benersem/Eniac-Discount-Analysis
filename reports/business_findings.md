# Business Findings: The Discount Effect on Eniac

## Overview
An analysis of Eniac’s product categories and discount strategies has revealed significant insights regarding revenue distribution and discount effectiveness. The findings indicate that a targeted approach to discounting is required to maximize profitability while maintaining premium positioning.

## Category Performance
- It was found that **Storage & Devices, Accessories & Peripherals, and Cases & Protectors** were the primary revenue-generating categories.
- The **"Other" category** was observed to contribute significantly to revenue, despite not being classified within a main category.

## Discount Effectiveness
- A **moderate discount range (10-20%)** was identified as the most effective in increasing revenue.
- **Deep discounts (50% and above)** were not found to result in proportionally higher sales revenue, indicating diminishing returns.
- **Seasonal variations** in discount responsiveness were observed, with certain categories displaying distinct seasonal patterns.

## Key Insights
### Not All Categories Require Discounts Equally
- It was observed that different categories exhibited varying responses to discounts, indicating that a **one-size-fits-all discounting approach may not be optimal**.
- Certain categories were found to **maintain stable sales regardless of discount levels**, suggesting that discounting in these areas may be unnecessary.

### Seasonal Discount Trends
- **Cases & Protectors** were found to respond positively to holiday promotions (November-December).
- **Accessories & Peripherals** demonstrated strong sales performance in winter months (November-January).
- **Storage Devices** showed increased sensitivity to discounts in November, indicating a potential **Black Friday opportunity**.

### Impact of Discount Depth
- It was determined that the **10-20% discount range** yielded the most effective balance between revenue generation and sales volume.
- Higher discounts were found to **fail in generating proportional increases in sales**, making them less effective.

## Recommendations
### Implement Category-Specific Discount Strategies
- It is recommended that **higher discounts be applied selectively** to categories that demonstrate a strong response to price reductions.
- Categories that perform well without discounts should maintain their **premium pricing strategy**.

### Align Promotional Calendar with Seasonal Sensitivity
- **November-December:** Cases & Protectors should be prioritized for holiday promotions.
- **January:** Accessories & Peripherals should continue to be promoted.
- **March:** Discounts on Accessories & Peripherals should be reconsidered, as data analysis indicated **limited responsiveness** during this period.

### Optimize Discount Levels
- It is suggested that **discount bands within the 10-20% range be further refined** to determine the most profitable level.
- A **gradual reduction in deep discounting** should be implemented where evidence suggests it does not yield proportional sales increases.

## Areas for Improvement & Further Investigation
- A **more detailed analysis of the "Other" category** is required to determine potential hidden revenue opportunities.
- A **customer segmentation analysis** should be conducted to evaluate whether specific customer groups respond differently to discounting strategies.
- **Competitor price monitoring** is necessary to ensure that discounting strategies remain competitive while protecting profit margins.
- It was noted that **the available data covered only the year 2017 and the first three months of 2018**, making it challenging to perform a comprehensive **seasonality analysis**. Future analyses would benefit from a **broader dataset** covering multiple years.

## Conclusion
The findings suggest that a **balanced, strategic approach to discounting** is more effective than an aggressive or blanket discount strategy. Rather than choosing between deep discounts and maintaining premium positioning, Eniac can benefit from **targeted discounts applied to the right categories at the right time**. This approach is expected to satisfy both the Marketing Team’s objective of using discounts as a customer acquisition tool and the Board’s goal of preserving profitability and brand positioning.
