# 🛒 Eniac Discount Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Data Analytics work for Eniac**, an e-commerce tech company. The goal is to analyze how discounts impact business performance by evaluating customer behavior, revenue changes, and product pricing patterns.  

As a **Data Analyst**, I will:
- Clean and preprocess messy internal data.
- Investigate pricing trends, discounts, and sales performance.
- Use **Python** and data visualization techniques to extract insights.
- Deliver a **business-driven analysis** that helps settle the ongoing debate about discount strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis  
- **Markdown & Presentations** for reporting
